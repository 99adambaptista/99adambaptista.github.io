    Dragging partially works, only one way though. Dragging onto the board is 
possible, but removing tiles from the board back to the table is not possible.
I had a bunch of trouble trying to get the dictionary working. At first I tried
to use a dictionary JSON, but my browser kept giving me an error saying that it
was a sercurity risk to read the file. I then tried to use ajax to get it from
an online dictionary, similar to how Yong Cho did in the example in the PDF, 
but I could not read the data from the response. When I tried to return the 
status code from the ajax get, it would always return as undefined so I just
gave up in the end. Tiles can also be placed anywhere on the board, but the
board wont allow for submissions of the word if there are any spaces inbetween
letters.
    Everything else works as intended.
