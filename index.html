    My very first webpage ever, nothing much, just my name at the very top and center
    using css and html. Background was taken by myself at Mt.Osceola summit, and a link
    to an interesting article about reviving woolly mammoths.

    Passed both HTML and CSS validators.

            The company, called Colossal, plans to use genetic engineering to modify elephant DNA and create a hybrid animal that resembles the woolly mammoth. It sounds like something from science fiction, if not horror. But the mission of Colossal is very real. The company seeks to revive the woolly mammoth by creating a hybridized elephant with its characteristics, all to help fight climate change.

            “Our goal is to have our first calves in the next four to six years,” said Ben Lamm, a tech entrepreneur who helped found Colossal.
            
            The idea to revive the woolly mammoth first originated from a scientist named George Church. A biologist with Harvard Medical School, Church has developed ways to read and edit DNA. He began to wonder if that technology could be used to resurrect...
