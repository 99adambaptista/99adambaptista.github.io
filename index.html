    My very first webpage ever, nothing much, just my name at the very top and center
    using css and html. Background was taken by myself at Mt.Osceola summit, and a link
    to an interesting article about reviving woolly mammoths.

    Only used W3 schools to figure out how to do everything.

    Passed both HTML and CSS validators.
